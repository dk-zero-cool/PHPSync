/**
 * =====================================================================
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  SYNC PROCESS
 *
 *      When we backup, any compressed file will get the name [name]#sync:[md5].
 *      The hash value makes the files non-unique, meaning that there
 *      could easily be multiple files with the same real name. It also makes it more
 *      dificult to check if a file exist, unless you have the complete name incl. the hash.
 *
 *      Because of this, the first round should WALWAYS be on the directory containing
 *      the files with hash valued names. That means 'dst' during backup and 'src' during restore.
 *      That way we can handle exisiting hash valued file names first and use round 2 'second'
 *      to handle files not currently synced.
 *
 *      It's important that 'src' runs 'SELF_FIRST' and 'dst' runs 'CHILD_FIRST'.
 *      We always sync from 'src' to 'dst' meaning that 'src' will be creating a lot of
 *      directories while 'dst' will be deleting some. When deleting a directory, we need to empty
 *      it first and creating them is best to do one at a time.
